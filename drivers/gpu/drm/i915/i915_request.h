 * constructing a priority queue for waiting. Prior to its execution, or

 * value to change between reads. Only when the request is complete can
 * the global seqno be stable (due to the memory barriers on submitting
 * the commands to the hardware to write the breadcrumb, if the HWS shows
 * that it has passed the global seqno and the global seqno is unchanged
 * after the read, it is indeed complete).
